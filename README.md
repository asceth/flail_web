Web interface for http://github.com/asceth/flail using Rails 3.

* Designed to be deployed as a normal Rails 3 application which means you need to copy/link/etc your own database.yml, config.ru (if mounting differently), etc.


###### Interface
Inspired from the few screenshots I saw of Github's internal haystack tool on various presentations from their employees.

For these screenshots, [voyager, enterprise, github and flail] are all unique tagged applications.
